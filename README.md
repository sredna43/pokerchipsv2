# Pokerchips V2

A client/server app that simulates poker chips so you and your friends can play poke without physical chips!

# Client

The client is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using SvelteKit (see client's readme for more info)

# Server

The server is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) using the [Gorilla Websocket](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket) and the [Gin Web Framework](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin)

# Why V2?

Well, [V1](https://github.com/sredna43/pokerchips) is pretty messy, and doesn't really work since I may or may not have abandoned it... This one should be much cleaner.
